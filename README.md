![learnyounode workshop done](node_basic_1/learnyounode_finished.png)

I got a better understanding of NodeJS basics, like starting and interacting with the HTTP server. All tasks are very interesting but the most useful for practical wise is the last one about HTTP-JSON-API server.

### functional-javascript-workshop

![functional-javascript-workshop done](node_basic_1/functional-js-finished.png)

My previous JS experience is not so diverse and commonly limited to DOM manipulations. So there many things that were new to me, eg, blocking event looping, currying, function spies, partial application without using .bind and trampoline. Also, sometimes JS works in mysterious ways and it's hard to understand how and why to use this or that thing on real do. Thereby I need more practice for a better understanding of functional JS in some parts.
